# Guide

## 1) SMALL SPREAD + LOW/NORMAL TOTAL (tight defensive grind)

Stars (32–36 min, clear usage):

✅ Points OVER – best spot (usage + secure minutes)
✅ Rebounds OVER – very strong (more misses, full minutes)
⚠️ Assists – only if primary handler vs weak defense
❌ 3PM – pass unless high‑volume role

Non‑Stars (18–28 min):

✅ Rebounds – high‑energy wings/bigs on low lines (1.5/3.5)
❌ Points/Assists/3PM – pass (low possessions)

## 2) SMALL SPREAD + HIGH TOTAL (tight + pace = fantasy paradise)

Stars:

✅ Points OVER – excellent
✅ Assists OVER – BEST spot for PGs/playmakers
✅ 3PM OVER – if they shoot 6+ 3PA
⚠️ Rebounds – neutral (fewer misses)

Non‑Stars:

✅ Points OVER – if 25+ min role
✅ 3PM OVER – shooters on 1.5/2.5 lines
⚠️ Assists – only clear 2nd unit PG
❌ Rebounds – pass

## 3) MEDIUM SPREAD + LOW/NORMAL TOTAL (5.5–8 pts) (controlled game, sneaky minutes risk)

Stars (32–36 min, clear usage):

⚠️ Points OVER – best when (a) star is on the UNDERDOG (chasing usage), or (b) you take modest ladders (20+/25+ more than 30+)

⚠️ Assists OVER – only primary handler AND opponent is weak at preventing assists / plays faster than average

✅ Rebounds OVER – good for star bigs (misses create boards; can get there even in slower pace)

❌ 3PM OVER – usually pass unless elite high‑volume shooter (role is literally “shoot 3s”)

Non‑Stars (18–28 min):

✅ Rebounds OVER – best non‑star angle here (energy rebounders, backup bigs with steady minutes)

⚠️ Points OVER – only if minutes are stable (starter-ish) or there’s an injury boost

❌ Assists OVER – usually pass (needs minutes + teammates converting)

❌ 3PM OVER – mostly pass unless the line is tiny (1+) and player’s only job is to shoot

## 4) MEDIUM SPREAD (5.5–8 pts) + HIGH TOTAL (shootout, some blowout risk)

Stars:

✅ Assists OVER – still good (pace advantage)
✅ 3PM OVER – volume shooters
⚠️ Points OVER – good but check blowout history / coach rest patterns
❌ Rebounds OVER – pass (efficiency kills boards)

Non‑Stars:

✅ 3PM OVER – low lines (1.5/2.5)
✅ Points OVER – if minutes secure
❌ Assists/Rebounds OVER – pass

## 5) BIG SPREAD + HIGH TOTAL (≥8 pts) (blowout risk shootout)

Stars (Favorite):

❌ All – pass; minutes risk too high

Stars (Underdog):

✅ Points OVER – usage spike chasing
✅ 3PM OVER – catch‑up threes
⚠️ Assists OVER – only primary handler
❌ Rebounds OVER – pass

Non‑Stars:

✅ Points/3PM OVER – dog bench shooters, garbage time
❌ Assists/Rebounds OVER – pass

## 6) BIG SPREAD + LOW/NORMAL TOTAL (≥8 pts) (defensive blowout)

Stars (Favorite):

❌ All – pass (minutes + scoring both capped)

Stars (Underdog):

✅ Points OVER – if he’s the entire offense
✅ Rebounds OVER – chasing boards
❌ Assists/3PM OVER – pass

Non‑Stars:

✅ Rebounds OVER – dog bench bigs (garbage time)
❌ Rest – pass

If you want, tell me what sport/league you’re primarily targeting (NBA only?) and I can adjust the thresholds (e.g., “high total” 228 vs 232) so it matches the distribution of totals this season.
